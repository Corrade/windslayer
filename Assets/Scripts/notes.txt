todo
    pre-match
    testing with multiple players
    respawning
    spectator cam

    refactor hit stun and blcok stun to different location probably


gamemodes
    deathmatch. team with most KO's at the end of the time wins. timer. dying -> spec -> respawn

spectator mode
    spec mode: click on player portrait to spec. keypress to cycle through players. dead players including oneself can be viewed; just goes to their gravestone. click on something to enter freecam, which is the default cam if there are no players or something

    spectator mode implemented by client? except ofc ignore all input from spectators
    should despawn player hitbox so they aren't involved in collision checks etc

game flow
    pre-match
        join team 1 or 2
        join spec
        leave arena
        setup arena (host only)
            max players (moves any excess players who've already joined a team into spec)
            gamemode (implement later)
                kill limit
                time limit
                respawn time
        start game (must have at least one player on each team)
    
    combat
        upon death, respawn after a while. whilst waiting move into spec

    end condition
        freeze all players, announce winner, force show scoreboard, transition to pre-match

totally invincible during hit stun?

blocking perhaps deviates from the original game: when you're hit whilst blocking, you enter block stun, which interrupts your block. in windslayer it seems like you didn't get stunned at all.

landing on the ground whilst doing an air move: the air move continues on the ground

attack used: startup -> active -> recovery
                               -> OR INSTEAD attacker stun (if you are airborne, hit an enemy and they don't block it. such airborne hits are only possible if you're using a light/strong attack)

hit by enemy -> block stun (if blocking)
             -> OR INSTEAD hit stun

attacker stun and hit stun: suspended (preserve velocity) + silenced + disarmed, also brief invincibility
    hit stun behaves as above when applied by an ability used from the ground https://youtu.be/4JMx2fWfuD8?t=220
    attacker stun behaves as above when applied by an airborne strong attack https://youtu.be/YG4tUOohzkk?t=43

duration
    FOR THE SAME MOVE
    block stun < attacker stun < hit stun
    recovery ~= attacker stun (for an equivalent attack when performed on the ground vs airborne) (?)

if you're hit while in attacker stun (and possibly other stuns), you immediately go into the hit stun / block stun (well, you wouldn't be blocking if you're in attacker stun). this may actually be shorter than your current stun.

    often in pursuit of maximum flexibility (minimal immobility), you introduce needless complexity

    design smells
        - rigidity: change is difficult, often requiring multiple other changes to be made
        - fragility: a single change causes widespread breakage
        - immobility: the design is hard to reuse
        - viscosity
            - software viscosity: change is easier to implement through hacks rather than good practices
            - environment viscosity: development environment is slow and inefficient
        - opacity: difficult to understand
        - needless complexity: contains constructs that are not currently useful. usually a symptom of developers being too far ahead of requirements
        - needless repetition
        - data clumps: different sections of code contain identical clumps of data, e.g. fields in many classes, parameters in many methods. consider consolidating these things into a new class and passing around larger objects, e.g. entire ‘classes’ rather than fields
        - refused bequest: when a subclass doesn’t use or must redefine something in the superclass. consider revising the inheritance and pushing fields and methods from the superclass into subclasses. e.g. if an engineer class inherits an employee class that is mostly suitable but has sales quota fields and methods that the engineer never uses, one should consider moving that sales information to a salesperson subclass
        - switch statements. prefer polymorphism and consider the strategy pattern

    characteristics of good design
        - loose coupling: small chains of dependencies between modules
        - high cohesion: modules and classes are themed and internally unified by some goal

    design principles
        - apply design principles only in response to design smells, not just randomly
        - unconditionally conforming to a principle often leads to needless complexity
        - solid
            - single responsibility principle: a class should only have a single responsibility
            - open-closed principle: software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
            - liskov substitution principle: subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. all of a superclass’ methods should make - sense in the context of a subclass
            - interface segregation principle: many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
            - dependency inversion principle: one should ‘depend upon abstractions, not concretions’
        - law of demeter/principle of least knowledge
            - classes should know about and interact with as few classes as possible
            - classes that are known/interacted with should be nearby
        - reduce long segments of code by extracting methods
            - identify legs where certain variables aren’t changed; they can be parameters to a new function
        - move methods so that they belong to the class of whose data they use the most
        - encapsulate to protect, e.g. setters and getters
        - program to an interface, not an implementation
        - when implementing different variations of an entity, favour polymorphism/subclassing over conditional logic with variables
            - not suitable if you need to be able to change variations
            - not suitable if it’ll result in an overwhelming number of classes, particularly if there are multiple things being varied
        - favor composition over inheritance

c#
    public: access is not restricted.
    protected: access is limited to the containing class or types derived from the containing class.
    internal: access is limited to the current assembly.
    protected internal: access is limited to the current assembly or types derived from the containing class.
    private: access is limited to the containing type.
    private protected: access is limited to the containing class or types derived from the containing class within the current assembly. available since c# 7.2.


    virtual vs abstract
        an abstract function cannot have functionality. you're basically saying, any child class must give their own version of this method, however it's too general to even try to implement in the parent class.

        a virtual function, is basically saying look, here's the functionality that may or may not be good enough for the child class. so if it is good enough, use this method, if not, then override me, and provide your own functionality. and remember you can reference this the parent's implemention from the child using the base keyword, so there's still a point to specifying a virtual function that's always gonna be overriden.

    singleton vs static stuff
        A singleton allows access to a single created instance - that instance (or rather, a reference to that instance) can be passed as a parameter to other methods, and treated as a normal object.

        A static class allows only static methods.

        Plus static variables can't be exposed to the editor.

    https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html

    "Source engine server employs techniques such as data compression and lag compensation which are invisible to the client. The client then performs prediction and interpolation to further improve the experience."

    client side prediction uses the same code that the server uses for movement checking/logic


    always send inputs, not position
    not sending the data at all until the player is supposed to see it is the only sure way to keep it secret

    
    During each tick, the server processes incoming user commands, runs a physical simulation step, checks the game rules, and updates all object states.
